# Overview

This project is a mobile flashcard study app built as part of my journey to grow as a software engineer. My goal was to deepen my understanding of React Native, Expo, navigation patterns, state management, mobile UI design, and working with local databases. Building a complete end-to-end app helped me practice real-world development concepts such as data modeling, performance, component composition, and persistent storage.

The software allows users to create custom study decks, add cards, practice with an interactive flashcard session, and track their study activity. Everything is stored locally on the device using SQLite, giving the app offline capability and fast performance.

The app focuses on clean UI, smooth animations, and real data persistence—similar to what modern study apps offer.

# Development Environment

React Native + Expo for building the mobile application

Expo Router for navigation and screen organization

TypeScript for type safety and cleaner code structure

SQLite (expo-sqlite) for persistent local data storage
(Decks, Cards, Stats, Recent Activity)

NativeWind (Tailwind for React Native) for styling

Expo Linear Gradient for UI gradients and card styling

VS Code as the primary IDE

Android device for testing using Expo Go
